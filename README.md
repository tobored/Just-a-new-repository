Hello,
I'm Tim. I'm new to programming and just want to learn more about it. This started a time ago i've found programming intressting for a long time. Only i could not find anything to learn more about it in a easy and nooby way descriped. last night i was trying to reboot my andriod and it finally worked but is had cost me the whole night and morning. after that I macigly landed here. 
sorry for my english its not my home language.

P.S. I think i ate to much moon tacos last night.
